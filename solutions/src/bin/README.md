# Adent of Code executables

This directory contains the executables for the Advent of Code solutions.
Each executable is a separate day's solution.

The executable should read the input from `stdin` and write the output to `stdout`, one part per line.
If desired, the executable can output debug information to `stderr`.

The executables are named `yearYYYY_dayDD`, where `YYYY` is the year and `DD` is the day.
The executables can be written in any language, with any extension.
If the file is not Rust, it should have a shebang line at the top to specify the interpreter and be marked as executable.
